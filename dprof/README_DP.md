# Oracle PL/SQL Profiling / Flat Profiler

The Oracle PL/SQL Profiling module contains the code for a series of articles demonstrating the use of three PL/SQL profiling methods on two example program structures. The examples are designed to illustrate their behaviour over as many different scenarios as possible, while keeping the examples as simple as possible. This submodule, on Oracle's flat profiler, is one of three covering each of the profilers individually.

Blog: [PL/SQL Profiling 2: Flat Profiler](http://aprogrammerwrites.eu/?p=2867)

The root README shows the scenarios covered with call structure diagrams for the two examples, and has a table summarising the features of the different profilers. These are extracted from the overview article. It also has full installation instructions for running the three profilers on the two example program structures.

- [README: Root](../README.md)

The current, detail, README shows the data model for the flat profiler, and summaries of results on the second, simpler, example. These are extracted from the detail article linked above. It also shows how to install and run just the Flat profiler on the two examples.

### Calls to Units with EXECUTE ONLY Access
- [Results for Example 2: Sleep](https://github.com/BrenPatF/plsql_profiling/blob/master/dprof/README_DP.md#Results-for-Example-2-Sleep)

The manual states "you cannot use the package to profile units for which EXECUTE ONLY access has been granted". In this example there are calls to two units where this applies: the system package DBMS_Lock, and the custom utility package Utils, which is in a different schema (lib) from the one (app) in which the script is run.

In the output above we can see the lines from which the calls are made but nothing within the units called.

### Aggregate/Detail Timing Discrepancy
- [Results for Example 2: Sleep](https://github.com/BrenPatF/plsql_profiling/blob/master/dprof/README_DP.md#Results-for-Example-2-Sleep)

Where the flat profiler does not provide data for program units, such as DBMS_Lock.Sleep, the timings at the detail level do not add up to the overall time recorded in the runs table. As there were three calls using elapsed time of 11 seconds in total the total recorded in the runs table is 11 seconds, while this 11 seconds is missing from the detail records, which add up to only 265 microseconds in total.

## Running Driver Scripts
[Schema: app; Folder: dprof]
- [In this README...](https://github.com/BrenPatF/plsql_profiling/blob/master/dprof/README_DP.md#in-this-readme)

You need to have first run the [prerequisite installation](..\README.md#installation)

 ### Create Flat Profiler Components
If the script has not already been run from the root README:
- Run script from slqplus:
```
SQL> @install_dprof_app
```

### Run Driver Scripts
- Run scripts from slqplus for general and sleep examples (output will be in .log files):
```
SQL> @dp_example_general
SQL> @dp_example_sleep
```
